## My process

### Built with

I learned basic to intermediate html and css in this project. I was able to structure and style this landing page using html tags and styling properties of css.


### Continued development

I will continue focusing on html blocks and positioning properties of elements which are techniques I found useful that I want to refine and perfect with time.



### Useful resources

- https://fonts.google.com/  - this helped in selecting fonts

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ - this helped me find useful documents on certain properties of css which were difficult to understand.
